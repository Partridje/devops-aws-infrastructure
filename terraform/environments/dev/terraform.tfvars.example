# Project configuration
project_name = "demo-app"
environment  = "dev"
aws_region   = "eu-north-1"

# Network configuration
vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

# Application configuration

#####################################
# HTTPS/SSL Configuration (Optional for dev)
#####################################
# See docs/HTTPS_SETUP.md for detailed setup instructions
# NOTE: For dev environment, HTTPS is optional. HTTP-only is fine for testing.

# ACM certificate ARN (leave empty for HTTP-only in dev)
# certificate_arn = ""  # e.g., "arn:aws:acm:eu-north-1:123456789012:certificate/xxx"

# Enable HTTP to HTTPS redirect (only works if certificate_arn is provided)
# enable_https_redirect = false  # Keep false for dev (allow HTTP access)

# SSL/TLS security policy (only applies if HTTPS is enabled)
# ssl_policy = "ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01"

# Database configuration
database_name = "appdb"
rds_port      = 5432

# Monitoring configuration
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST confirm email subscriptions after deployment!
# After running 'terraform apply', AWS will send confirmation emails to all addresses.
# Click "Confirm subscription" link in each email to receive alerts.
#
# See docs/SNS_SETUP.md for detailed setup instructions
#
# What you'll be notified about:
#   - Infrastructure issues (unhealthy hosts, database problems)
#   - Performance degradation (high CPU, slow response times)
#   - Application errors (from logs)
#   - AWS events (EC2/RDS state changes)
#
# Recommended: Use distribution lists (devops@example.com) instead of individual emails
#
# Examples:
#   alert_email_addresses = ["devops@example.com"]
#   alert_email_addresses = ["dev-team@example.com", "john.doe@example.com"]
#
alert_email_addresses = [
  # "devops@example.com",
  # "team@example.com"
]

# Security configuration - YOUR IP ADDRESS
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Most ISPs use DYNAMIC IP - it changes daily/weekly!
#
# Get your current public IP:
#   curl ifconfig.me
#
# Choose one option:
#
# Option 1: Allow ALL (testing only, 2-3 hours, then destroy)
# allowed_cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
#
# Option 2: Your current IP (recommended, but update when it changes)
# allowed_cidr_blocks = ["203.0.113.45/32"]  # Replace with your IP
#
# Option 3: Your ISP's IP range (find via: whois $(curl -s ifconfig.me))
# allowed_cidr_blocks = ["185.123.0.0/16"]
#
# Uncomment and choose one:
# allowed_cidr_blocks = ["YOUR_IP_HERE/32"]

# Notes:
#####################################
# 1. Update the backend configuration in main.tf with your S3 bucket name
# 2. Run ./scripts/setup-terraform-backend.sh before terraform init
# 3. Ensure AWS credentials are configured (aws configure)
# 4. This is a cost-optimized configuration for development
# 5. Resources will cost approximately $84/month
